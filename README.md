# Project Title (Replace with your project's name)

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for. (Replace with your project's description)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory-name>
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

To run the project in development mode with live reloading, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the development server at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default) or another port if configured. Check your terminal output for the exact URL.

Alternatively, you can use:

```bash
npm start
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the project, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will compile the TypeScript code (using `tsc`) and then bundle the application using Vite. The output files will typically be placed in a `dist` directory.

## Other Available Scripts

- `npm run serve`: This command can be used to preview the production build locally.
- `npm run test`: This command runs the tests using Vitest.
